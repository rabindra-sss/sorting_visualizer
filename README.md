# Sorting Visualizer with C++ and SDL2

This project is a dynamic sorting visualizer that showcases various sorting algorithms using C++ and the SDL2 library. It provides an interactive platform for users to learn and observe the sorting processes of different algorithms.

Controls Use '0' to generate a new randomized list. Use '1' to start Selection Sort algorithm. Use '2' to start Insertion Sort algorithm. Use '3' to start Bubble Sort algorithm. Use '4' to start Merge Sort algorithm. Use '5' to start Quick Sort algorithm. Use '6' to start Heap Sort algorithm. Use 'q' to exit the visualizer.
